#   I LITE Wordpress Theme

I LITE is a minimal Wordpress theme that was designed with love.

I designed and created it on Feb 2011 when I first started to learn web design and development. So basically it’s the first and experimental project I’d worked out.

Feel free to download and fork it on Github.

Check the live demo here: http://ilite.me
