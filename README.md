#   I LITE Wordpress Theme

I LITE is a minimal theme that was designed with love, and was for life recording.

I designed and created it on Feb 2011 when I first started to learn web design and development. So basically it’s the first and experimental project I’d worked out.

Feel free to download and fork it on Github.
